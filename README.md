# Recetario

Little web app project for personal use. In spanish for the moment. Maybe in english too
in the future.

The idea behind is just to host it in my local network and have a web app to store recipes
in my house. Therefore, for the moment, no authentication or sophisticated security is
currently in mind.

## What have I learnt

**This is my first web app project**, thus I did not want to use any sophisticated framework like React, Angular or anything like that neither Bootstrap for the CSS. In the process of making this web app I have learned:

- [x] HTML5 markdown. (Remember, first web app)
- [x] CSS3 styling. (Remember, first web app)
- [x] Building a responsive web app being able to use it comfortably in smaller screens.
- [x] Building a web server with Express
- [x] Server side rendering with EJS.

## Dependencies

- Express
- SortableJS
