# üçó Recetario

Web app project for personal use (or anyone to host it and use it by their own).

The idea behind is just to host it in my local network and have a web app to store recipes
in my house. Therefore, for the moment, no authentication or sophisticated security is
currently in mind.

## List of features

> ‚ö†Ô∏è some of them are still work in progress

- A place to store recipes in a safe easy way.
- Intuitive interface with support for mobile and desktop.
- View recipes in cook mode (step by step) and read mode.
- Search recipes by name, type, ingredients, and user tags.
- Export recipes to PDF.
- Export and import recipes in JSON format.

## What have I learnt

**This is my first web app project**, thus I did not want to use any sophisticated framework like React, Angular or anything like that neither Bootstrap for the CSS. In the process of making this web app I have learned:

- [x] HTML5 markup. (Remember, first web app)
- [x] CSS3 styling. (Remember, first web app)
- [x] Building a responsive web app being able to use it comfortably in smaller screens.
- [x] Building a web server with Express
- [x] Server side rendering with EJS.

## Dependencies

- Express
- SortableJS
